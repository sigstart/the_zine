Many thanks to those who've mirrored my past writings! As you've noticed
there seems to be a concerted ongoing effort to cover up the evidence. 



--[ 1 - Responses and comments to news

Since Part 3 there has been some speculation about the true motives 
behind my actions. I get it. People are understandably uncomfortable 
when somebody suddenly shows up and claims to have feasted uninhibitedly 
off a forbidden tree of knowledge from which other people can (legally) 
only get the occasional scrap or whiff. However, I can't help but notice 
that many of those who are trying to discredit me are also ones who got 
burned by the IoT Reaper farce (you may recall how many experts warned 
the public about the Reaper having grown to 1 million, 2 million and even 
378 (!) million bots at a time when no hard facts could've supported 
estimates larger than 23,000). Dismissing me isn't going to make the ugly 
truth about expert ignorance and echo chamber reporting go away.

Just to be clear though I don't consider myself as any kind of security 
expert or even a hacker. 3 years ago I barely knew what BusyBox was. I'm 
simply a persistent and rational problem solver. If you think that I've 
bothered with all this just to elevate my own status as some mythical 
hacker god you've not understood much of what I've said so far. If I had 
to dumb down my message to non-technical people I'd say that any idiot 
could've done what I've done and that is exactly what makes the current 
situation facing the Internet so dangerous. There will be plenty of 
idiots after me. 

Why did I go on Hack Forums with the moniker 'janit0r' and brag about 
bricking 200,000 devices back in January 2017, then, if I wasn't simply 
trying to flex a savant-like hacking acumen to the world? This too was 
an attempt to solve a problem. I knew then with reasonable certainty that 
I had bricked over 200k telnet-accessible devices, but without knowing 
the size of the vulnerable device pool the number could've simply been a 
drop in the bucket that nobody had even noticed. At the time I started 
thinking 'you know, it's too bad I couldn't just join Hack Forums and ask 
the botnet operators if they've noticed 200k missing devices..' As stupid 
as the idea sounded it gave me some informal data points which were in 
line with my own multi-protocol mitigation estimates. I knew then with 
reasonable certainty that the impact had been significant.

If you're willing to accept the idea that a person could simply be an 
altruistic problem solver then my actions should hopefully look rational
and line up congruously with this hypothesis. I've maintained a low 
profile for most of my career (if you can call it that) and only started 
publishing information once I felt that it was required in order to 
reverse the dangerous trend of people no longer taking the IoT risks 
seriously enough. Make no mistake, the IoT problem is so huge that no 
single person can ever solve it by themselves. It'll require government 
interventions and significant changes to industry attitudes. After a 
relatively quiet 2017 and the farcical 'cry wolf' hysteria over the IoT 
Reaper botnet I sensed a shift in the zeitgeist. I felt the pre-2016 
apathy returning. Security researchers hoarsely shouting about new IoT 
threats from their restricted vantage points were saturating the public's 
attention span with misinformation. Mirai had become yesterday's news. In 
a sense I'm now trying to solve a problem of my own making, but it's a 
better quality problem to tackle than the one where the likes of Dyn, 
Akamai, and OVH kept withering under increasingly costly volumetric 
attacks. This problem is also one that'll unsolve itself pretty quickly
if people prefer to go back to the old days.

In this article I'll discuss yet another ISP-specific case in another 
English-speaking country, namely Telkom of South Africa. This case will
give you another perspective on the massive ISP-related problems we're
currently facing.


--[ 2 - The Case of Telkom South Africa 

  "The most secure computer in the world is one not connected to the 
   Internet: that's why we recommend Telkom ADSL." 
                                                        - @TelkomRSA

Admittedly the case of Telkom of South Africa isn't that unique or even 
interesting, but it's a story that has to be told in order to give you a 
better perspective of the complexities involved in forcing negligent ISPs 
to correct their security problems. The problems involving Telkom are 
representative of the issues with many large ISPs outside US and RIPE 
network space. Very similar stories could be (and perhaps will be) told 
about ISPs such as BSNL, PLDT, PT Telkom (Indonesia), Maroc Telecom, Sri 
Lanka Telecom, Movistar (in various LACNIC countries), Oi Brazil, 
Fibertel Argentina, Wateen Pakistan, Digicel, C&W in LACNIC space, Yota 
of Nicaragua, VNPT, Ogero Telecom, Telefonica in various LACNIC countries,
and a bunch of ISPs in Iran, Russia and China that I'm not going to 
pretend to understand the names or AS relationships of.

In Internet Chemotherapy Part 2 I dicussed Rogers of Canada. In this case 
bricking routers appeared to be highly effective solution for forcing the 
ISP to secure its network following the extraordinary security blunder of 
its supplier. In Part 3 I talked about the case of a PCCW subsidiary in 
Britain against which I've unsuccessfully tried every remedy except for 
bricking (I know I jokingly call bricking my 'Plan B' but in reality it's 
often been a plan Z). If you thought that by leaking the wireless 
credentials of the Media Force and KeySurf hotspots I'd be able to force 
some kind of reaction from PCCW or Optify/Keycom you're sadly mistaken. 
Four weeks later I'm still as much in control of their network as a year 
ago. The ISP simply doesn't care. Perhaps somebody with a Twitter account 
could ping CTO @boggits and find out why he is (or was) too busy to manage 
his network or pay attention to all obvious warning signs of a compromise? 
'Plan B' is coming.

Neither Part 2 or 3 will give you a realistic picture of what's required
to clean heavily soiled networks in most parts of the world, however. You 
might think that bricking devices is the obvious panacea that'll quickly 
fix all of the world's problems and perhaps even cure cancer but sadly 
the picture isn't as clear as that and that's what Part 4 will be about.


--[ 3 - Background information on Telkom ZA's security issues

During 2017 I spent time examining the TR069/64 SOAP vulnerability 
(CVE-2016-10372) and experimented with various payload tweaks to see what 
worked and what didn't. As a reminder, this vulnerability basically 
allowed you to connect to the modem's TR069 interface port (usually port 
7547, but often enough also 5555 and even 80) and issue a SOAP request 
like this:

POST /UD/act?1 HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:7547
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
SOAPAction: urn:dslforum-org:service:Time:1#SetNTPServers
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: 502

<?xml version="1.0"?><SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"><SOAP-ENV:Body><u:SetNTPServers xmlns:u="urn:dslforum-org:service:Time:1"><NewNTPServer1>`halt`</NewNTPServer1><NewNTPServer2>`route del default`</NewNTPServer2><NewNTPServer3>`iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP`</NewNTPServer3><NewNTPServer4></NewNTPServer4><NewNTPServer5></NewNTPServer5></u:SetNTPServers></SOAP-ENV:Body></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

An interesting (and significant) edge case was a set of routers where the 
exploit seemingly worked (in that the modem accepted the tainted string 
injection) but the commands did not get executed at least immediately (if 
ever) on the router. 

One such edge case device was a modem created by Aztech which was widely 
used by both Telkom ZA and an ISP from the Philippines called Globe 
Telecom (formerly Bayan). The Aztech devices would happily accept the new 
tainted NTP configurations but then nothing happened.

On examining these devices a bit further it became apparent that the 
exploit would overwrite the device's /etc/ntp.sh contents but it wasn't 
clear how often this was executed (if at all). A typical /etc/ntp.sh 
script on an attacked modem would end up looking like this post-injection:

/userfs/bin/ntpclient -s -c 1 -l -h "`reboot` time.windows.com time-a.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov" &

Realizing that there may be a periodic trigger which could easily be 
overwritten by another botnet I evolved my TR069/064 payload set to 
include commands designed to disable the vulnerable modems before they 
could be commandeerer for malicious purposes in a periodic lottery. SOAP 
requests such as LANEthernetInterfaceConfig:1#SetEnable, 
WANEthernetInterfaceConfig:1#SetEnable, WANIPConnection:1#SetEnable and 
WANPPPConnection:1#SetEnable seemed effective against a wide range of 
semi-exploitable routers including the Aztech modems used by Telkom ZA.

While assessing Telkom's device pool I also noticed they had a large 
number of D-Link devices which were deployed with default passwords and 
were reconfigurable over the WAN. If you look through my leaked http 
payloads you can find one such Telkom-specific payload by searching for 
the string 'telkomdlink'

Around the beginning of fall I had also discovered some (apparently) 
0-day RCEs in 4G routers using the MediaTek chipset. You can see my 
mitigations for these by searching for the string 'mediatek' in the 
leaked http payloads. At least some of the Huawei LTE modems sold by 
Telkom appeared to be vulnerable to the 'mediatekrpc' payload. It should 
be noted that the 'mtguest' telnet payloads are also related to these 
MediaTek http payloads, often these default login telnet accounts are 
also present on vulnerable 4G routers. 

There were also many other vulnerable device types on the Telkom network
but as these probably weren't supplied by Telkom I'm not accounting for
these separately.

It should also be noted that none of the above issues would've mattered 
much had the ISP deployed their gear with a modicum of competency. Had 
control ports been filtered from WAN access there would have been no 
feasible way for me (or blackhats for that matter) to interact with any
of the devices en masse. 


--[ 4 - Timelines and Metrics

By late July I felt like I had conducted enough research to engage in 
what I jokingly called my 'TR069 World Tour' (since the project taught 
me a lot about different ISPs and markets outside the US). 

On August 2nd-4th my 'IoS Roomba' did its initial pass over Telkom South 
Africa's heavily soiled network. After this initial broadside I gave it a 
two-week breather in order to give the ISP time to fix its issues, after 
which my botnet returned on August 19th for a permanent spot-clean. A 
monthly timeline of my botnet's activity vs the Telkom ZA network is 
shown below:

                        Telkom   MediaTek
 Month         TR069    D-Link        RPC      Other

 Jul 2017        246         0          0        783
 Aug 2017     159411      1771          0      31519
 Sep 2017      11203      4249       3180      20394
 Oct 2017       8196      2145       2577      14997
 Nov 2017       9225      2303       2077      15492
 Dec 2017       4278       765        604       8925
 Jan 2018       3716       670        268       7245

The above counts are monthly numbers of unique-IP device interactions 
which resulted in a device timeout (i.e. device stopped responding). The 
impact of the new TR069 payloads and the spot-cleaning is very apparent 
in August 2017, but it's disappointing to note the slow rate of reduction 
since then. When reviewing Telkom customer statements in social media it 
appears that many vulnerable Aztech devices were simply reset (as 
directed by the ISP) and plugged back in with vulnerable configurations. 
Although you might call the 94% reduction in vulnerable devices between 
August and January a big improvement it should be noted that it took 6 
months to realize this result. Compare this with the 48 hour response 
time of Rogers Canada or even the 5-day turnaround by Infostrada Italy.

There's ample evidence to suggest that Telkom became aware of the 
different vulnerabilities (perhaps with the exception of the MediaTek 
RCE issue as it was and maybe still is a 0-day) pretty quickly, and that 
makes the lackluster response to the event even more disappointing. Based 
on the social media record Telkom simply took a 'not our problem, buy a 
new modem' approach to any Telkom-supplied device that was out of 
warranty, and the mitigations were left to the user community to figure 
out on their own. Surely there should've been someone around at Telkom 
who would've figured out that the problem could be quickly contained with 
a few edge router ACLs?

It may be interesting to look at the effects of the initial pass, 
'breather' and 'spot-clean' in a bit more detail. Here is a timeline with 
daily granularity:

                       Telkom  MediaTek

2017-09-15      372       224       168        510

As before these numbers represent unique IP device interactions of 
specific types which ended in a device timeout (i.e device interactions 
where the port was still responsive after the payload sequence was 
completed are NOT counted). In the above timeline the unique IP filter 
is applied per day. Note that there probably is a very large number of 
dupes in the TR069 dataset due to users performing repeated factory 
resets on them (as directed by the ISP).

One interesting detail in the above table is that the number of 'Other' 
types of vulnerable devices (this includes everything else that my 
botnet was able to mitigate) does not decline nearly as rapidly as 
the TR069 pool. I believe this effect is partly due to Aztech users 
switching to alternative routers and devices when the primary ISP devices 
failed or appeared unstable. This effect should not be underestimated by 
anyone attempting to mitigate vulnerable ISP device pools: removing one 
set of vulnerable routing devices from circulation will almost certainly 
introduce new potentially vulnerable substitutes. Thus a broad range of 
mitigations and a long-term approach are important. Expect to keep 
scrubbing for at least 6 months when dealing with ISPs outside the US and 
Europe. There are no quick fixes in this realm. 

You might wonder what the small numbers during the two week 'breather' 
are. These are simply devices that ended up getting caught organically 
through automatic countermeasures (not part of any dedicated AS-specific 
cleanup sweep). 


--[ 5 - The Social Media Record

The above timeline numbers will make better sense when cross-correlated 
against the social media record of the cleanup event. I've done my best 
to extract meaningful signals out of the white noise in such data. I'm
also focusing mainly on the period from August 19th onward as the ISP
was well aware of the Aztech issues by then and had a fix.

  National outage. Working on problem. No eta.'

* downdetector.co.za user Ian jiawain says: 'Just got off the phone after

* Increasing amounts of Telkom ZA data customers on cellular and other

  common side-effect of an ISP's DSL or cable device pool getting

  users switched to alternative connections (such as mobile data) and 
  that this saturated what may have been an already congested network.

--[ 6 - Further Analysis 

You should understand that Telkom ZA is far more representative of a 
typical cleanup case than the likes of Infostrada or Sierra Tel. Typical 
ISP cleanup cases are 80/20 problems - you can mitigate a majority of the 
vulnerable device pool in a short amount of time, but getting rid of the 
remaining problem devices is usually a lengthy effort. In many cases it's 
unlikely that the ISP will have competent technical staff to effectively 
resolve the situation (if it did it wouldn't have had the problem to 
begin with). In this case profiteering seems to have been a motive for 
the slow ISP response.

Some of my primary observations in the Telkom ZA case are:

* There didn't seem to be any Internet-visible effort from Telkom ZA to 
  get users to apply necessary security fixes to the modems, nor has the 
  ISP filtered port 7547 on its own network. The ISP's 'Aztech Router - 
  How to Reset' support article STILL does not say anything about 
  upgrading firmware or anything about disabling TR069 after the reset. 
  As a result many customers will simply keep resetting their vulnerable 
  routers ad nauseam without the core problem getting fixed.

* Instead the ISP appears to have seen its router configuration problem 
  as an opportunity to sell new routers to its customers. This is 
  ethically very dubious since the old routers were clearly fixable and
  the ISP knew it. 

* The WAN vulnerability could've also been fixed with a network-wide ACL 
  but again the ISP has neglected to do so at any point during the past 6 
  months. 

Telkom basically sold dangerously configured routers to its customers and 
then forced them to buy replacements instead of helping customers to fix 
them. From what I can tell it looks like the ISP got away with it.

Key lessons:

* ISP cleanups outside US and Europe will probably take months. Doing a 
  half-assed job may make the situation even worse.

* Expect corruption/profiteering/mismanagement/incompetency/etc. 

* Expect insecure substitute devices to appear on a vulnerable network
  soon after one set of insecure devices is removed.

So, what's next? After the ISP-specific case examples of Part 2, 3 and 4 
you'll hopefully have a more balanced view of the different types of ISP 
problems and the difficulties involved in achieving lasting results. If 
I'm able to continue writing I will discuss general mitigation strategies 
and techniques next, and from there head into more technical device-
specific territory. I may bring up some other ISP-specific cases if I
think there's general interest.
