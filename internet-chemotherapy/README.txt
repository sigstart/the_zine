Internet Chemotherapy
=====================

This is a mirror of a series of articles written by "Dr Cyborkian a.k.a.
janit0r, conditioner of 'terminally ill' devices". Janit0r is the same name that
the creator of BrickerBot used in 2017. It is relatively well established that
the 'real' Janit0r wrote the first post in the series (see Bleeping Computer
article [1]). It is also believed that Janit0r wrote the other eight parts.
